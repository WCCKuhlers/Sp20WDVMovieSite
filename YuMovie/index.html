    <h3>The Plot</h3>
    <p>For those who don't know, Avengers Endgame is the follow up movie to the Avengers Infinity War movie. Avengers Endgame was about what happened 5 years after Thanos (The antagonist) snapped his fingers and wiped out half of the universes population. The Avengers had killed Thanos, but he destroyed the infinity stones before they got to him. So this left the universe in chaos. Earth was able to take it well and managed to move on from what was known as the "blip." One day, Antman shows up on the Avengers door step and gives them an idea to use time travel to go back and restore the universe. Now they all must group up back together and restore everything.  </p>
    <h3>Why this movie is one of the best</h3>
    <p>I think that Avengers Endgame is one of the best movies of 2019 for many reasons. One reason I like this is because of many characters that they combine into one universe like Thor, Rocket, Captin Marvel, and many more amazing characters. Another big thing about the movie that I thought made it amazing was call back to previous Marvel movies like the first Avengers movie.</p>

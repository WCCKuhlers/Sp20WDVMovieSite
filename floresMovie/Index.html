    <h2>Summary of Movie</h2>
    <p>
        Basically this movie about 5 teenagers who are completely different but similar walk into a saturday detention. They 
        all have their own problems no matter how different they may be. It's the first time 
        they met but it changed their lives forever. There's a brain, a beauty, a jock, 
        a rebel, and a recluse. They come together and break rules but touch each other in ways they 
        never thought they could. That's as much as I can really say without spoiling the movie
        to you.
